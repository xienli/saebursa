#Bio

I'm an Android Developer who focus on application performance and user experience.
For now, I use Java as my language-of-choice for building my apps. But also I learn about web development, especially JavaScript recently and sometimes I learn a bit about C for my building kernel devices.

I also love enhancing my devices performance by hacking the linux kernel, and tweaking some software configurations.

When Iâ€™m not on the text editor, I enjoy playing video games, shopping, watchi
