## Make your site searchable

If you want to open up your site to Google and other search engines, simply remove the **robots.txt** file from the root of your project. 

## Remove noreferred and/or nofollow attributes

Edit the **mdIterator** plugin settings in your .eleventy.js configuration file to change these settings for external links.
